# Hi,
I am Andrew and I like to code.
I fool around in Visual Basic, code in Python, make websites in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, make apps in C#, and programming the Arduino. I am still learning all of these programming languages, but I mainly focus on programmingg in Python. 
Want to learn Python too? run this line of code and you will see `Hello World!` In the console:
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
You can also output `Hello World!` to a file:
```python
file = open("helloworld.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello World!")
file.close()
```
